However,there are steps that, once learned, turn the chore into a delight, and the pen will fly across the page accomplishing the purpose with style and creative aplomb. “But I’m not in high school; I don’t write essays any more,” you say. Every time one writes a thank you note, a letter to the editor, a letter of complaint, a letter of recommendation, an evaluation, or even communication to the family, that person is applying rhetorical modes and distinct purpose to his effort. Good writers aren’t born to the process; they learned the steps and have found the joy in putting words in print. Greg Camp is a published writer of books, editorials, and, of course, essays. If you are writing for publication or you want to improve your writing skills, let Greg show you how to turn your groans into big smiles."},{"link":"EventList.aspx?fromdate=11/18/2017&todate=11/23/2017&display=Day&type=public&eventidn=32303&view=EventDetails&information_id=75740","name":"Tertulia (Spanish Conversation Club)","desc":"Expand your knowledge and improve your speaking skills by joining Tertulia (Spanish Conversation Club)!
